            What do you mean by “Computer Programming”?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
            Computer programming, also known as computer coding, is a series of tasks implemented to achieve certain
            figurative results. The process takes place through the meaningful execution of computer programs. It
            involves planning and coding algorithms, reforming a program, and also maintenance and updating different
            structured codes.

            Do you know about High level and Low-level programming languages?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            High-level programming languages are not dependent on the machine type you are using. A high-level
            programming language is highly simplified. It is close to regular languages so that programmers can have an
            easy experience with program development. For example, C, Java, FORTRAN, etc. are high-level programming
            languages.
            On the contrary, low-level language is close to machine language. The low-level programming language offers
            no simplification of machine instructions. Such as Assembly language.

            What are “translators” in computer programming?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Translators in computer programming are processors for different programming languages. Translators convert
            programming languages and make it readable by the machine. In a word, translators translate different
            programming languages into machine languages. There are three types of translators in computer programming.

            Can you explain what “debugging” is?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Debugging is a process. Through this process, your machine can find faults or errors in your programming. It also resolves or fixes defects that prevent your written code from executing certain tasks.
            This process is continued through Debuggers, a software that helps programmers to find errors, execute a program, monitor the entire process, and stop it whenever it is needed.

            What do you know about “Variables”?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Variables are often referred to as “containers” for information. They reserve information that is to be mentioned in programming later. Variables can also be modified for the proper execution of code anytime, anywhere. Variables are separated by memory address, a.k.a location. Often they come with symbolic addresses whose value can be changed according to the requirement of programmers.
            The main purpose of variables is to stock data. This data can be used throughout your programming.
